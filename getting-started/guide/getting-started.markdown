# Getting started with the Creative SDK for Android

The Creative SDK lets you build applications that integrate with the Creative Cloud and leverage its power to benefit your users. 

From letting your users import from and save to their Creative Cloud storage, to using innovative Photoshop APIs via your application, the Creative SDK will help you expand the features of your app by using the Adobe platform.

This guide shows you how to get up and running with the Creative SDK for Android, including how to authenticate your client, a necessary step for integration with the SDK.

_**Note:** The Creative SDK for Android is now available as a **remote Maven repo**. It is no longer available as a download from this site. See the the first step of **the section "Adding the SDK to a New Project" in this guide** for details._

<a name="github"></a>
## GitHub

You can find companion GitHub repos for the Creative SDK developer guides [on the Creative SDK GitHub organization](https://github.com/CreativeSDK/android-getting-started-samples). 

Be sure to follow all instructions in the `readme`.

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

1. Before you can work with the Creative SDK, you must register your application and get Client ID and Client Secret values. For details, see [Registering Your Application](#register).
1. The following software is required:

    - Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
    - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) 2.0 or higher
    - [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) 16 or higher
    - Gradle 2.1.2 or higher
    - Android build tools version 23.0.3 or higher
    - Android Support Repository 32 or higher


_**Note:** The Creative SDK supports Android API Level 16 as the lowest [minSdkVersion](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min), and the recommended [targetSdkVersion](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target) is API 23._


<a name="register"></a>
## Registering Your Application
When you register your application, you are automatically approved for Development Mode. 

- _Your Client ID must be [approved for **Production Mode** by Adobe](https://creativesdk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204601215-How-to-complete-the-Production-Client-ID-Request) before you release your app. See the [What's Next?](#whats-next) section for details on submitting your app for Production Mode approval._

To register your application for Development Mode, follow these steps:

1. Sign in or register for a Creative SDK developer account
1. Go to the [**My Apps** page](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/myapps.html)
1. Click "+ NEW APPLICATION"
1. Fill out the form, then click "ADD APPLICATION"


_**Important:** As part of registering your application, you are given a Client ID and Secret. Write these down and save them. You will need them in the future, and this is the **only time** you can see them._


<a name="new-project"></a>
## Adding the SDK to a New Project
The Creative SDK is now offered as a remote Maven repository. This section will show you how to add the Maven repo and the Creative SDK frameworks.

1. Add the Maven URL for the Creative SDK repo and the Gradle Retrolambda Plugin to your _Project_ `build.gradle` file

	Your Android Studio project contains by default two `build.gradle` files. In the _Project_ `build.gradle` file, add the lines under comments **#1-3**:

    ```language-java
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.2'

            /* 1) Add the Gradle Retrolambda Plugin */
            classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.3.0-beta4'

        }
    }

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()

            /* 2) Add mavenCentral */
            mavenCentral()

            /* 3) Add the Creative SDK Maven repo URL */
            maven {
                url 'https://repo.adobe.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases/'
            }
        }
    }

    task clean(type: Delete) {
        delete rootProject.buildDir
    }
    ```

	Be sure to sync your project with the Gradle files after making any edits.

1. Configure your _Module_ `build.gradle` file

	To get the project ready to use the Creative SDK, there are few things we'll need to add here. See comments **#1-4** in the code below.

    ```language-java
    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

    /* 1) Apply the Gradle Retrolambda Plugin */
    apply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'

    android {
        compileSdkVersion 23
        buildToolsVersion "23.0.3"

        defaultConfig {
            applicationId "com.adobe.gettingstarted"
            minSdkVersion 16 // Minimum is 16
            targetSdkVersion 23
            versionCode 1
            versionName "1.0"
        }
        buildTypes {
            release {
                minifyEnabled false
                proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            }
        }

        /* 2) Compile for Java 1.8 or greater */
        compileOptions {
            sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
            targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        }

        /* 3) Exclude duplicate licenses */
        packagingOptions {
            exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
            exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
            exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'
            exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
            exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
            pickFirst 'AndroidManifest.xml'
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.4.0'
        compile 'com.android.support:design:23.4.0'

        /* 4) Add the CSDK framework dependencies (Make sure these version numbers are correct) */
        compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:auth:0.9.1062'
    }
    ```

    _**Note:** `com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:auth` is a basic requirement for Creative SDK integrations._


<a name="client-auth"></a>
## Integrating the Authentication Component
Client authentication is required to use the Creative SDK. You can authenticate your client with the Client ID and Client Secret you have obtained from the [**My Apps** page](https://creativesdk.adobe.com/myapps.html).

1. Create an `Application` subclass

	For this example, we'll name it `MainApplication`.


1. Configure your `Application` subclass

	Add the following code to your `MainApplication` class:
    
    ```language-java
    public class MainApplication extends Application implements IAdobeAuthClientCredentials {
        
        /* Be sure to fill in the two strings below. */
        private static final String CREATIVE_SDK_CLIENT_ID = "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>";
        private static final String CREATIVE_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET = "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>";

        @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            AdobeCSDKFoundation.initializeCSDKFoundation(getApplicationContext());
        }

        @Override
        public String getClientID() {
            return CREATIVE_SDK_CLIENT_ID;
        }

        @Override
        public String getClientSecret() {
            return CREATIVE_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET;
        }
    }
    ```
   
1. Register the Main Application in the Android Manifest
    
    Inside of the top level <code>application</code> tag, we will add a new attribute: `android:name=".MainApplication"`

    ```language-xml
    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
        android:name=".MainApplication" >
        <activity
            // ...            
    ```       

1. Run the app

    That's it. You have registered an app, added the SDK, and implemented client auth in just a few simple steps.

    Go ahead and run the app. You won't see anything happening yet, but you have the foundation for your integration with the Creative SDK.
